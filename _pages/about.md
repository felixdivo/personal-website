As a <u>computer science student</u> and <u>software developer</u>, I am passionate about â€¦

- building [smart and robust systems](robotic_sailing).
- interdisciplinary [research](publications) and development.
- following both foundational & applied research.
- [open source collaboration](bio).
- automation and [programming](projects).

In my <u>free time</u>, I enjoy â€¦

- strolling through forests ðŸŒ³.
- playing [underwater rugby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_rugby) and (board) games.
- sailing (and especially navigation).
- pondering social questions.
