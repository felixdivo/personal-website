I'm an <u>AI Researcher</u> doing a PhD supervised by [Prof. Kristian Kersting](https://www.aiml.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/people/kkersting/index.html).
I am passionate about …

- opening the black box of time series forecasting to build models we can <i>trust</i>.
- bridging opaque data domains with natural and formal languages.
- tackling real-world challenges via interdisciplinary collaboration (finance, manufacturing, oncology, … yours next?).
- exploring diverse ML frontiers like tractable probabilistic models (TPMs), graph neural networks (GNNs), large language models (LLMs), and causal discovery.

You can find out more on my [group's website](https://www.aiml.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/people/fdivo/index.html) (teaching assistant, supervised theses, publications).

As a student, I led the robotic [Sailing Team Darmstadt e.V.](robotic_sailing) for several years and contributed to various open-source projects.
During that time, I was also active as a freelance software engineer [for various clients](projects).
