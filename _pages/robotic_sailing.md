## Software Contributions

Over the years, I spent countless hours **with my friends** developing software for the boat(s).
While starting out as a small tinkering project, we steadily grew it into a rather professional-like development effort driven by the growth in memberships.
One of my main contributions there were the modularization of the large code base that has grown over years
and the introduction of clear quality principles supported by extensive [CI tools](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/).
Additionally, I developed (mostly in [Python](https://www.python.org/)):

- A foundational library for working in cartesian (`x, y`) an polar (`latitude, longitude`) geometries.
- Import and transformation of various data formats, like [nautical navigation charts (ENCs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_navigational_chart) and [topography data](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/iapg/forschung/topographie/earth2014/).
- Tools for creating globe-spanning navigation graphs and augmenting them with datasets.
- A system for managing [local tangent plane coordinates (LTPs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_tangent_plane_coordinates) and object permanence.
- Interfacing with [hardware](https://www.st-darmstadt.de/ueber-uns/boote/), among others using the [python-can](https://pypi.org/project/python-can/) library of wich I am now [one of the core developers](https://github.com/hardbyte/python-can/graphs/contributors).
- A novel tool for writing declarative test cases for [ROS2](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/).
- [Property-based](https://hypothesis.works/) and [mutation](https://mutmut.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) testing.
- A lot of infrastructre and tooling behind the scenes.
- More …
